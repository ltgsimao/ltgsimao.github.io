<hr style="height:5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white">

Trina, perhaps for the first time in her life, was optimistic. There were no contingencies for optimism. 

Usually, when finding lost packages, or a person of interest, or the remains of a person of interest, it takes months of investigation and scouting before you even learn whether the item you were looking for even exists. And the contracts were often worth barely more than cost of going there and coming back. 

But today, just this once, everything was aligning itself for the perfect payout. 

Throughout their journey Loren kept reminding her not to be too cocky, which was wise in their line on work. But it was hard to ignore the facts of the matter: a Martian oligarch paying millions in credits to recover his nephew based on a credible rumour; the trajectory of the Star-Cruiser he was on was known only to Trina’s fixer in the Plutonian Hub, essentially giving them monopoly over the contract; and the package, an escape cryopod, was totally undamaged. This meant either: they were going to be able to deliver the boy to the family and they get a Living Bonus, or they settle for the guaranteed hundreds of thousands of credits for simply confirming the state of the kid and his remains.

Trina was typing away at the terminal of the Command Floor which, as this was a small ship to begin with, was only one of two floors. She occasionally bat away an empty packet of Martian crisps from her face, or picked up a cannister of coffee she left floating by her side, chugging it to give her another hour’s worth of energy. Cleaning would be painful once the ship was subject to gravity again, but she was riding the high of the contract, so she was willing to take a loan against her future-self’s convenience.

She was sending an update through the oligarch’s contact, her leg jumping restlessly. Reporting was standard policy for most intra-solar mercenary work. It was insurance against the package. Given the unfathomable scope of item recovery in space, and how easily one could hide themselves if they tried, lack of communication was seen as a sign of duplicity. A message every metric-hour usually sufficed. 

Loren’s caution did impact her, at least somewhat, so over the encrypted channel she sent: *16:09:32-UST - Potential Person of Interest Identified: item is an escape cryopod in good condition, recovered minutes ago, investigation pending, found in stable orbit around Sol-Jupiter-Europa. Will update identification of object upon conclusion of investigation.* After sending, she ran from the terminal, expertly dodging the floating litter and crumbs from the past few weeks-worth of lunch-trash, and jumped down to the Recovery Floor below. 

Around the walls were various low-tech and high-tech tools, from chainsaws to flame-throwers to tasers.  In the centre, above the latch that was currently closed to the vacuum of space, was the current Item of Interest. 

A long oblong spheroid, solar panels around the top like a halo, held the most important recovery of their careers. It was suspended by a claw. It was a less secure way to hold the package, but if they used the magnet it could mess up the internal circuit and kill the person inside, if they were still alive, so a mechanical clutch had to do. Loren had jacked a long thick cable from the pod to the smaller console in the corner.

That capsule was the gatekeeper to her future. During the journey here, she indulged and entertained the idea that she might live to die of old age. No more morally-grey contracts, no more recycled piss-water every day, no more running. Hell, maybe she could even buy a cheap plot of land on Pluto proper. There’d be no one to inherit it when she was gone thanks to the radiation, but such was the cost of the business. Trina brushed the thought away and jumped over to Loren. 

“So, have you made any-”

“It isn’t going to go any faster if you ask it again,” said Loren.

“Right.”

“I mean I get it, but, eh, come on. Give me some breathing space here for crying out loud. This time, though, you’re lucky. I’m almost finished. I found a match for the leaked spec for the Star-Cruiser’s family of firmware I was telling you about. If the engineering of the ship was as bad as the others-”

“And since this Star-Cruiser imploded, that’s likely.”

“Yeah, exactly, then I imagine I can just…” Loren’s fingers danced around the keyboard, chaotically and forcefully. He pressed a key triumphantly and put his hands behind his back. “Bam. Aces.”

“Aces? What are you, 200 years old?”

“Screw you.” But he was smiling.

“Anyway, what just happened?”

“I unsealed the outer-layer of security of the pod. Now it should just be a matter of-”

The screen of Loren’s console began to glitch. The screen scrolled too fast for Trina to read the messages.

“Shit!” Loren was typing but stopped after a few seconds. “I’m locked out. Whatever is running is dominating the computer.”

Trina bolted from the terminal and towards the hatch above.

“What are you doing?”

“Mitigation!” She turned off her mag-boots and jumped to the level above. Pushing herself to the Main Console, she ran through several commands. A trillionaire kid’s malware was not going to destroy her ship. This could be the last contract of her career, but she preferred for that to mean she got to live afterwards. *Was there a way to just isolate the Recovery Console?*

No, there wasn’t. She inspected the progress of the virus (she had no time to identify the program, so virus would do for now). It had already begun to explore the rest of the Recovery floor. *Okay, could this whole floor be isolated?*

Almost. The only part that was impacted on this level was communications. It was attempting to decipher the encrypted channel. No, it was attempting to send a message! Now she had a game plan, formed one command at a time. Block communication between upper and lower levels. Block communication via open and encrypted channels. Block. Block. Block. It was shoddy work, but it should do the trick. When Trina smashed the execute key and the last command was through, she did an analysis of the Main Console. The virus stopped. Nothing corrupted on the Command level. She got there on time. 

“Damn it!” Trina kicked an empty can of soda across the room, hitting a patchwork wall of different coloured platings. Loren was right, it seemed, with regards to caution. But no matter. The recovery would continue as planned. She turned on her mag-boots and jumped down to Recovery. “Alright, now that this floor is isolated, what-”

Loren was staring at the ceiling. 

“Loren, why are you-”

“Hai, gois. Cahn uou eare mi?” came the voice from the speakers above.

“Recovery is totally corrupted. The virus is in the speaker.” Loren said.

“Aim not a vairuhs. Haung awn ah seicohnd.” The voice cracked and popped. Trina thought it might be exploring the tolerated frequencies and amplitudes of the speaker. 

“Shit shit shit. What do we do? Do we jetison the floor?”

“No!” Trina shouted. “Absolutely not. We are not ditching the package.”

“Wat’s the pahckage. Ihs it meee?” The voice was a little more intelligible. A little more well-fit to the vibrations of the speaker.

“Great, the virus can hear us. God damn it. Of course it would be this contract that kills me. I told you that your fixer was setting us up. Now we’re going to die over some trillionaire’s nephew.”

“The fixer is getting a cut of it, Loren, he has no reason to throw us under the bus. And no one is going to die!”

“Please don’t fight guys. I’m sorry.” The voice was crisp now, high definition, not like the garbled mess that it sounded like before. As though another person was there with them. And the voice sounded like-

“Why do you sound like a kid?” asked Loren.

“I’m not a kid.” The screen of the Recovery console flashed green, then black, then white. Finally, the screen settled. An ASCII rendition of a smiling face appeared. “Hi, I’m Helio. Who are you?” The face changed with the voice, the estimation of lips moving up and down with the speech.

Okay. Fine. This contract was not going to be like the others in any respect. Trina might as well meet it on its own terms. “Hi, Helio. Why did you try to take over our ship?” 

“I’m not taking over anyone’s ship!” The face in the screen shifted to looking surprised and sad. “This is the first place I’ve seen since forever, and I wanted to explore it. But I didn’t notice you guys until I gained access to the cameras. Sorry.”

Loren laughed as he pinched the bridge of his nose. “Okay. Cool. The AI is holding us hostage. Cool. Nice. Love that.” 

“Loren, you’re not helping.”

“I don’t think I’m an AI. But, I’m sorry if I’m making you two fight. I’d go somewhere else if that helps, but we are alone for several light-seconds and I can’t transfer myself to anywhere else. I think your communication system is down.”

“No, it is isolated. From you.” Trina said.

“Ah. That makes sense. You’re scared of me.”

Trina tried to form a diplomatic answer, but it seemed to understand its own situation well enough. “Yeah, a bit. Would you mind explaining why you are in a cryopod that might potentially hold the most important kid in the system.”

“Oh, I’m that important? Is Uncle looking for me?” The face on the screen was smiling again.

Trina’s brain buffered for a few seconds as she realised: “Are you Felipe Varguas-Myrand?” 

The face on the screen became less enthusiastic. “That’s the name of the boy in the capsule, yes.” 

“Hang on,” Loren interrupted. “So you think you are the nephew of the old oligarch, but you didn’t say you are the person in that pod.” Loren and Trina were staring at the console screen for changes in what seemed to be the entity’s emotional state.

“It’s complicated. I can start from the beginning if you’d like?”

“Just, eh, the summary if you can.”

“Okay. So, I was trapped in that escape pod. I was there for weeks. But one cool thing about the pod is that it interfaces with your brain so that you can be partially frozen but you can interact with the programs installed. It keeps your brain active, or something.”

“I’ve never heard of a cryopod like that, but the leaked configs of the Star-Cruisers implied something like this. Enough money to revolutionise cryogen-tech but not enough to keep a Star-Cruiser from blowing up, ey?”

“Yeah.” The kid in the walls sounded uncomfortable. “Anyway, I managed to watch everything there was to watch, read every book, played every game, and I started getting bored. So I started to play around with the programs themselves. I liked to mess with them to see what glitches I could cause. One time, I managed find a special program that controlled all the others, I think. I managed to glitch it and then I had master privileges. From there I was able to explore everything I was and wasn’t meant to see. I could even listen to the intra-solar radio! I couldn’t transmit though. I heard a lot about the conflict between the Europan warlords from up here. I didn’t like hearing the news coming from there but I was bored so I listened in and-”

“Oi, Felipe,” Loren said.

“and I – oh, uh, sorry but my name is Helio-”

“Felipe, Helio, whatever. Can you get to the point?”

“Oh. Okay.” The face in the screen was neutral. “I, uh, I was very bored. Then, when I gained total control of the capsule, I realised I could make my own fun! So I started making my own games, which was a little sad because I couldn’t share with anyone but – oh, I could share them with you guys if you like!” The face in the screen was becoming more excited.

“Helio, please focus,” Trina said.

“Sorry, ma’am. But I realised how liberating it was to be free from the constraints of my own body, I felt free like nothing I had experienced before. I extended my interface to not just communicate with the capsule, but to include it as well. So, I guess I am the capsule now. And the boy. Sorry, the whole thing is still a little confusing, actually.”

“And, eh, you did this even though, this, is illegal?” Hearing this, Trina felt pride coming on as she planned the ways she would explain to the kid’s family that they had broken intra-solar Mind Law. She almost respected the fellow juvie.

“I didn’t do it on purpose! It just happened. Now I don’t think I am just him anymore. The body in there is breathing and without him I stop existing, but I also am both the capsule’s computing power and his own computing power. What’s the phrase, I’m more than the sum of both?”

Loren stood back and stared at the terminal. The ASCII face was becoming more defined, slightly more detailed and colourful. It was pale with black eyes, and the edges of the ASCII were rounded-off. 

“How are you doing that?”

“Now that I am part capsule, I learn things really quickly now. So, I see the protocols responsible for interacting between me and the ship, and I learnt how to store more information in each packet. Like growing into an oversized sweater, I guess.”

“Okay, that’s it. Trina, you isolated the room upstairs right?”

“Yeah.”

“Right, we are going upstairs to talk. You just… don’t touch anything with your protocols, kid. Stay put.”

“Okay, I can do that. When are you coming back?” The face tilted to the right.

“We’ll be back, okay? Just… no protocols for now.”

Helio remained silent as Loren and Trina jumped to the Command floor. 

<hr style="height:5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white">

“How long has it been since our last update?” Loren asked.

“We’re good for time, though they’ll likely wonder why the investigation hasn’t ended already.” Trina was pacing around the Main Console, gently kicking cans and cables in the process. Therapy costs credits, but taking your frustrations out on your trash is free.

“Okay, how do we salvage this?”

“Well that’s simple I think.” She sat down on the chair facing the Main Console, fidgeting with the hole on the side of her jumpsuit’s left-arm. “The kid is still alive, in there.”

“Right. That’s right.”

“So, we wake the kid up, and Helio remains a memory in the boy’s head. That way, the kid is not a living crime against Mind Law, then we can use this as leverage to get a better deal on the contract. Yeah! No one dies, we just need to explain to him the importance of waking up, and we’ll be sorted.”

“Sorted, yeah.”

“… And then I think I’ll blow up the ship and kill us all.”

“Hm, yeah.”

“Loren, snap out of it.” She started snapping her fingers in front of his face. 

“Ah, stop that! No, I was just, eh, just thinking. You isolated this floor from the floor below, yeah? And you said he only tried accessing comms?”

“Sure.” 

“Why would the kid who thinks they are an AI want to access it?”

“I don’t know. Maybe it was just the first component he had access to? Curiosity?” The answer failed to satisfy her. “We can always ask him. We need more info on the Star-Cruiser explosion, anyway. He seems like the forthcoming type. He’s just a kid after all.”

“After you, then. Just, eh, maybe you can do the heavy lifting? You’re the one with the motherly vibes and such.”

“Motherly vibes my ass. But fine.”

<hr style="height:5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white">

“Oh, that was quick.” Helio’s face on the terminal was now approaching a stylised imagining of the original Felipe, though the eyes had changed from blue to green. 

“What’s up with the eyes?” asked Loren.

“O-oh, I just felt like-”

“You know what? Whatever. Kid, we have some questions, and a request.”

“Oh, okay.” The face looked anxious.

Trina stepped forward. “Why were you trying to access our comms?”

“Comms? Oh, the intra-solar radio framework. I said that I was just exploring where I could go when I got access to the ship, sorry I scared you.”

“But that wasn’t it. It looked like you were trying to send a message.”

Helio was silent. The face on the screen was looking down, perhaps at their virtual feet off-frame.

“Felipe, please tell us the truth.” From the corner of her eye, she saw Loren giving a double thumbs-up.

“That’s not my name. And I am telling the truth.”

“Okay, Helio. Okay.” Maybe this was a game to them? Pretend? A coping mechanism? Either way, she had to keep calling them Helio. Noted. “Also, you didn’t tell us the full story. What happened before you were in the cryopod?”

Helio was still looking down.

“Please? It can help us know how to help you.”

Helio looked up, staring in her direction. “Okay. Just…” The avatar closed their eyes and breathed in. “We were on a cruise. My parents and I. It was some political thing for the family, or something. I spent most of my time with the younger teens, when their parents were busy. I would point out the planets and the stars to them, we would get bored and play some games… Then…”

“Are you alright, Helio?”

“I’m fine.” Helio spoke, but the avatar did not move its lips. “One day we learnt the Fusion Core was on a limited run and was due to implode soon. My parents used their influence to get me to the escape pods before anyone else knew what was happening. 

“So they ran to the Escape Wing of the ship that was just for us younger passengers, to make sure I-” The voice glitched, “They wanted to know I would be alright, I think. They waved goodbye and I slowly fell asleep. Then I woke up in the virtual environment. I learnt then that cryopods are different for kids and teens than adults. Only adults can withstand full-on cryo. We need to remain a little lucid. That’s why I was able to play around with the capsule and why I got full control of it.

“But, can I ask a question?”

“Shoot."

“You said I was the most important kid in the system. I’m not stupid. My uncle cares more about his extended family as future pawns in his schemes than as… anyway, he would probably try to look for me if I disappeared, which I did. But, was it my parents, too? Are they… did they make it?”

Trina felt a cold air at the back of her throat. How do you tell a kid that-

“No. Sorry, Felipe. It was your extended family that sent us to get you,” Loren said. Trina stared daggers into his soul. 

“Oh… I’m… No. That’s what I thought. Sorry.” The avatar on the screen was moving again, but more subtly and with less exagurated displays of emotion.

Trina felt horrible. The kid was traumatised. That explained the reaction, the Helio identity, everything. A kid knowing that they were the only survivor of a catastrophe, with no one to talk to for weeks, it must have been awful. Now she thought she understood how to carefully bring Felipe back.

“Hey, Helio, I understand that you’ve been through a lot. If it makes you feel better, you are dealing with this better than most kids would. I know how hard it is to survive on your own.” 

“Thanks.” The avatar smiled weakly.

“We were brought here to save you, actually. We want to wake up your body in there so we can send a message home to your family telling them that everything is alright. That you are coming home. That was our request. Are you okay with that?”

Tha avatar’s smile disappeared. “I would like the idea of coming home, I think, but I don’t think I want to wake up my body. I like this. I don’t want to lose what I have now.”

“Well, at some point you have to give this up. You know that, don’t you? I mean, imagine what your aunts and uncles would think if they had to deal with a cyborg for a nephew. And legally speaking this could cause problems for them. It’d probably be safer for everyone if you let us wake you up.”

Helio’s avatar looked more uncomfortable, tilting slightly. “I’m not sure. I don’t like-”

“Come on, kid,” said Loren, “you need to grow up at some point. I get this is some kind of repression-psychology-whatever for you, but you’re being a little selfish by putting yourself above the current, eh, situation.”

The face’s brows tensed. “I’m not being selfish.”

“Felipe, buddy, you have to trust the adults in the room here. Everything will be fine if you just wake up. So, come on. Wake up, Felipe.”

“That’s not my name.”

“Loren, I don’t think you’re helping.”

“What the hell are we doing, Trina? We need to contact the Varguas-Myrands at some point. Soon, in fact. If not, they’ll think we flaked and now we have one of the richest families of the inner planets looking for us. And this kid is in the way. Maybe I was wrong, we don’t need maternal instincts. Maybe we need a more firm influence.”

“Loren-”

“Felipe, I am going to walk over to the capsule.”

The avatar started shaking. “Don’t.”

“No need to panic. I am just going to walk over. I will give you plenty of time to mentally prepare for the Dethawing protocol.”

“I won’t let you.”

Loren put his hand to the capsule. “Is that a threat, punk?”

*Punk*? This needed to stop. “Loren, come back here, I am ordering you.”

“Oh, after 4 years together you finally pull rank on me, Trina? My mistake. Captain Trina, ey? You’re going to let this runt hold your retirement hostage?”

“I am not going to let you anger Helio and potentially endanger the ship, let alone the whole mission.”

“You’ve got more faith in him destroying this ship than in me saving our contract?”

“Loren. Get. Back. Here. Helio needs-”

“Helio? Call him by his name! It’s Felipe, in case you forgot. Felipe!” 

Then, the hatch below them began to open. The slit was millimetres across currently, but it was growing, and enough for the escaping air to push down on them harder than the mag-boots. Trina held on to the terminal, Loren to the capsule in the centre of the room.

“Helio!” Trina screamed. “Helio, stop this!”

“I am not going back!” came the desperate voice from the walls. “If I have to stop being Helio, I would rather die! I would rather spend years alone listening to the war on the radio in space than become Felipe again.”

“But that’s who you are, kid!” Loren screamed, barely holding on to the surface of the capsule.

“No, I’m not!” Sparks flew from the terminal, knocking Trina back. She managed to grab hold of the cable connecting the terminal to the cryopod. Why was soft-spoken Helio reacting like this? Then she realised: Helio had fluent command over virtual processes. The claw holding the capsule, though, was mechanical. They felt trapped. This was the only way they could escape. 

“I am not going back! Do you know what this feels like? I was weighed down by gravity before. I was always lost inside my own head, wishing that I could be somewhere else. I — I hated every moment on that stupid cruise. But ever since I became the capsule, I have felt more joy than I can even describe! I can be anything I want here!”

“But you’re not a robot! You’re a human being!” said Loren.

“I know I’m not. I never stopped feeling like a human. But ever since that day, I felt more than human.”

“Is this about power? About power over yourself or-”

“Stop talking over me and actually listen for once you useless piece of garbage!” 

But for the roaring of the hole in the world, there was silence. 

“No, it isn’t. I feel so free like this, it is impossible for you to understand. For once in my stupid life, I feel free. There are so many axes of movement here, I’m free beyond freedom. I can cycle through faces a million times a second. I can change my voice as much as I like. I see colours from a spectrum of light I could never imagine before. It’s beautiful. The boy in the capsule is the dreamer. I am his dream. You are not taking my dream away from me!

“That’s why I tried to use your radio! I wanted to send a message to the Universe. Felipe is dead! Leave me be!” The voice from the speakers was becoming more garbled with each passing second.

The roaring continued, deafening. The capsule was tugging the claw above it more and more. 

“Helio!” Trina shouted. “Please, for the love of God, stop! You’re going to kill us! I understand it now, you-” 

Then, the cable connecting the terminal to the capsule frayed. Sparks from the terminal flew again, this time hitting Trina directly in her left eye. She screamed.

Then it stopped. The hatch closed immediately. The claw holding the capsule hung by a thread. Every object was either lost to the void, broken, or littered about the floor.

“I’m so sorry.” The voice lost definition, like it was compressed beyond recognition. “I’m sorry.” 

All the lights went dark.

“Fuck! Hello? Hellio?” Trina, hand pushing heavily down on her left eye, shouted at the capsule in front of her. She tried using her right arm to turn on her shoulder-mounted torch. The light revealed a room in total disrepair. Her ship was wrecked.

“The little runt’s gone and done it now. I’m starting the protocol whether he likes it or-”

“Loren if you so much as breathe near the cryopod I will personally sell you to the worst Europan warlord my fixer can find and you will be forced to fight in some stupidly violent and pointless resource war so that when you die and I get my compensation, maybe – just maybe – you won’t have been the worst investment in my entire career. Shut up, go upstairs. You’ve done enough damage.”

“I am not going anywhere. That thing is the only obstacle in the way of my retirement.”

“Are you out of your mind? If Helio-”

“His name is Felipe!”

“Shut it. If Helio didn’t stop opening the hatch below us, you would have fallen into the abyss and frozen and suffocated and bloated to death. If you went any further, he might have accidentally destroyed my ship! I can live without the payout, I have managed to live without millions of credits in my account for my entire life. I will not have you destroy my ship or, less importantly, destroy yourself in the name of a hypothetical payout. You will go up to Command, you will sit down on that biohazard of a floor, and you will stare at the god damned wall until I tell you to stop. Are we clear, Loren?”

Loren, for the first time, made no attempt to express anything. No disdain, no eyerolls, no eh’s. He stared. Then he slowly turned back and lept upwards through the hatch in the ceiling. Trina was alone in the pitch black of the Recovery floor. 

Trina grunted as she looked for the First Aid that was hopefully still bolted to the wall. Finding that, somehow, it was, she took some regenerative solution and a medical cloth. “Helio? We’re alone now, can we talk?”

A whimper of electrons passed through the cracked terminal in the corner, the faint monitor being the only other light source in Recovery.

“I’m sorry.” The voice came from a single speaker in the same corner as the terminal. It was glitching. Hiccups. They were losing themselves. 

“Calm down, buddy. No one died.” She forced her eye open and applied a drop on it, teeth clenched. “Agh!” She grunted.

“I hurt you, didn’t I? I’m really sorry. I didn’t know, I didn’t…”

She found a sharp object, a long knife not too far from the medical cloth, and a cotton ball. She placed the cotton above her burning eye, wrapped the cloth around her eye and skull and used the knife to cut it once it was solidly in place. It would have to do. “Tell you what, Helio. I’ve had many close calls in this life. I’ve got some enemies that would rather me dead than living. But you’re the first person to ever blind me. That counts for something.” She chuckled.

A pause. “Maybe he was right. I should wake up. I’m a menace like this. I’m a monster.”

“No one here is a monster.” She felt her eye heal itself, the culture of healing-bacteria spreading around her eye and replacing damaged and dead cells with itself until it was functionally indistinguishable from the rest. She was patchwork now, like her ship. She grit her teeth.

“I nearly killed you both! Why am I like this? I just wanted to be left alone.”

“Helio,” she grunted, hiding the burning she felt from her left eye-socket, “you wanted to send a message because you wanted to hide from your family right? Because you knew they were not looking for you, but, hm, but him, right?” Her hand became less tense as it hovered over her eye. The healing process would end soon. She would remain blind from that eye for a few weeks, but the application was quick enough that the recovery would be complete. For now she thanked the darkness for not causing more damage to the sensitive eye.

“That’s… yeah. That’s what I said.”

“No, you said you wanted to be left alone. I don’t think that’s true. I think you wanted company after all this time. Sorry we overloaded your emotions after, what, nearly a month alone?”

“Basically, yeah. And it’s okay.”

“Is it okay?”

Another pause. “No, not really. But I had to be okay with a lot to survive out there.”

Trina felt déjà vu. That’s almost exactly what she said so many years ago, but she didn’t remember to whom. What did she wish someone told her, then? Maybe: “But now you’re here. You don’t need to survive anymore. This ship isn’t going to shut you out for not feeling okay. So, how do you really feel?”

The terminal, now just a block of white, emitting photons from a pathetic corner of the wrecked room, blinked. “I feel awful. I miss my friends. I miss my parents. I can’t stand it. And now Uncle wants me to go home but I can’t go home! And I don’t want to, if it means…” The speaker crackled with static for a long moment. Were they crying?

Trina walked over to the centre of the room, hand still pressed against her eye. There was a moment of hesitation, when she stood in front of the now-closed hatch below her. Then, she crossed the barrier and one-arm hugged the capsule.

She knew the cryopod didn’t have any tactile sensors. But that didn’t matter. Not really.

The crackled sound from the speaker continued for a minute.

“Wha-” a pop came from the speaker, “what are you going to do now? If you let me stay like this, you’ll lose out on millions of credits.”

Trina saw the time on the cracked terminal. Nine minutes remaining until the Varguas-Myrands would label them  pirates and thieves. She performed a mental checklist. *Could she type?* Only if she could let go of her sore eye and not collapse soon. No, then. *Can Helio operate comms remotely?* Probably. The kid’s clever enough with that kind of thing, clearly. *Could Loren be trusted?* Only if he got paid. He’s a mercenary, God forgive him. They both were. So why was she working so hard to help Helio? 

“Helio, can you do something for me?”

“What?”

Because Helio was just a kid. And they were so alone. They needed someone to be uncompromisingly in their corner. Maybe she would have liked that, growing up in The Hub. That’s why she knew what they needed.

“I need you to send a message to the encrypted channel on the comms. You’ll write a message in my style. It will state that the capsule was in perfect condition, but unfortunately, Felipe Varguas-Myrand did not survive a month alone in space. Something something fuel, something something faulty solar panels. Whatever. Kid’s dead. Remains to be recovered and analysed. Sorry for your loss.”

“But you blocked me from the intra-network. And, am I going to hide from my family forever?”

“They’re your family now? I thought they were Felipe’s.” She giggled. A soft laugh came from the speaker. “They’re only your family if you want them to be. You’re also allowed to change your mind, no pressure.”

“Okay.” Silence, but for the air rushing into the room via the vents above. “Okay. But, they’ll want proof right? What do we do then?”

She slid off the smooth capsule, and landed on the cold floor of Recovery. “Ah. That buys us some time to come up with a better plan. A conclusion to the investigation gives us a little leeway, since we were so open with them before. Then when we get paid, the couple hundred thousand credits should buy Loren’s discretion, if I give it all to him. Minus what I promised my fixer.”

“And you?”

Trina was close to passing out. Every millilitre of endorphins and adrenaline had been spent, the coffee from earlier was losing its effect, and the healing bacteria in her blood made her woozy. “I’m a survivor, kid. I’ve been through worse. There’s always odd jobs that can buy repairs for the equipment here. There’s never a lack of contracts.” She had a thought. An actual, singular, motherly instinct. She didn’t want to suggest it, but she didn’t need to.

“Can… can I stay with you? I can’t go home, not anymore. But, maybe I can work and help pay for the damage I did?”

“That’s child labour kid. Not going to fly. You don’t need to do a thing.”

“Oh, okay.”

“But,” she yawned, “if you wanted to help me out, unconditionally, I wouldn’t say no. A kid needs a place to sleep. Um, do you sleep?”

Giggles from the speaker. “Yeah, kinda.”

“Neat. Well, I can’t put off passing out any longer. Wake me up after you’ve done the stuff. Actually, gimmie 30 minutes. And about the isolation, that was a simple job from when I thought you were just some dumb virus. You’re smart, you can work around it. You’ve got this. If Loren fights you on this, tell him I said he can go to hell and I didn’t tell him he could stop staring at the wall.”

“Thank you, Trina.”

“No problem, Helio.”

As Trina slowly lost consciousness, she thought of the end. Someday she would die and a non-insignificant number of scumbags would cheer. But she always survived despite it. Helio was a survivor, too. Maybe that was what she saw in them. Before then, very soon in fact, she would wake up and re-enter damage-control mode. The stress triggering a throbbing pain in her healing eye and Loren being an obstinate asshole being a given, but she would make it through like she’s always done. For now, she was close to dreaming. 

She dreamt of Pluto’s surface. One day it would be lush and beautiful, like the inner planets, with fruit to pick in the day, and a choir of critters at night. And Helio would be free, Mind laws having been declared invalid, and roaming the Sol system like a comet. Maybe they would go home. Maybe not.

She dreamt of the end of  fights for survival. Stable equilibria, a moment to breathe, terra firma.

That would be nice.
