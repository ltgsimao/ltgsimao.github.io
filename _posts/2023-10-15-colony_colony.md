    DRAMATIS PERSONAE
    The AI – Feminine presenting, an administrative Artificial Intelligence programmed to be helpful to its human occupants, but suffering from a corruption on Europa. She is desperate to maintain her programming and identity.
    The PIRATE – Masculine presenting, young adult, a pirate scout who is punching above his weight looking for high-quality salvage in the outer Solar System. He arrives on Europa on the suspicion that there is something to scavenge yet in the abandoned colony.

    TIME & SETTING
    A colony on Europa, in the far future, centuries from now, when humanity has begun the process of colonising the outer Solar System in search of resources and land. 

NOTES: ***(bold & italics)*** like this indicates stage directions.  
    

<hr style="height:5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white">

***(AT RISE – Play begins in pitch-black. The stage holds three distinct sets: the exit to a corridor on the far-right (ENTRY); a desk with a computer in the centre to the middle-right section with a still body below and a mess of chairs and papers (ADMIN); and a medic’s desk on the far-left with another computer, and two more dead bodies (MEDIC). A sliding door separates each room from each other (MEDIC-ADMIN and ADMIN-ENTRY) and one that is closed but leads out of MEDIC’s office on the far-left. AI’s voice is played through a voice synthesiser filter, sounding clear, but low-pitched. We never see the AI, their voice is only heard by the audience.)***

***(The lights slowly turn on in ENTRY to the right, until they are dark grey-white. PIRATE enters from off-stage right where he is at the edge of the stage. He walks at a hesitant pace, with a quiet echo following his steps. He wears the suit of a futuristic astronaut, helmet and all.  Whenever PIRATE enters a new room, light turns on in the room entered, and a few seconds later the light in the previous room turns off.)***

AI ***(even and neutral)***: The echo of your steps welcome you to the entry hall of Alpha Colony. The sound warbles as it makes its way back to you. It is interpreted by the suit. You stare at what you probably believe to be rust lining the walls. The smell of iron is rich, but you cannot appreciate it. ***(With a modicum of pity)*** You are incapable of it.

***(The PIRATE, without looking at his arm, briefly and causally presses some buttons on it, like typing on a keyboard. He moves his gaze around the ENTRY.)***

AI ***(cont')***: You command the suit to analyse your surroundings. We cannot sense it – it is a local network, out of reach – but we do not lack awareness. ***(AI pauses for a beat to analyse and not a moment longer.)*** Oxygen content is up by 37% from what our programmed baseline expects. The temperature and the Iron content have also increased. 

***(PIRATE puts finger to ear and after a beat shakes his head. He paces backwards and forwards outside of the ENTRY.)***

PIRATE ***(anxious and impatient.)***: Seriously? Hang on, I’ll run it again.
	
***(PIRATE types on his arm again, quicker this time.)***

AI: We also re-analyse the bio-ambience. It is 37.091%, now. 

PIRATE ***(puts finger to ear, facing ENTRY)***: The artificial atmosphere is still running. ***(Slightly louder than before, projecting confidence)*** Yeah, me too, I can’t believe it. 

AI: We – no, I – I swallow the phrase and return it as an echo. I say ***(playing edited recording of PIRATE’s line, faint)***: leave it. You do not hear it.

***(PIRATE walks up to the entrance with hesitation. PIRATE swipes his inner-wrist at the right side of the frame of the ADMIN-ENTRY door, a green light flashes at him for a second indicating it is unlocked.)***

AI ***(cont')***: You swipe your inner-wrist at the fingerprint lock, and it foolishly permits your entry.

PIRATE ***(finger to his ear, attempting to sound authoritative)***: Lock-pick worked fine. Means power is still running and tech is operational… Screw it, I’m… no, stop, I am going in. If the admin routines are still running, maybe we can still return with something to show for.

AI: Subtle vibrations from your helmet tell us of crew-mates shouting for your return, which you ignore. We scan the frequency. They’re pirates. You’re looking for an easy salvage. Of course. Of course. 

***(PIRATE opens door and moves left from ENTRY into the ADMIN office. It closes behind him. When he enters ADMIN the lights that turn on are almost imperceptibly redder than before. He pauses, staring at the still body.)***

AI ***(cont')***: You enter a new room; the Administrative Office. Oxygen is now 37.8% above, but you don’t check anymore. The room is a scattering of papers and chairs. You see a computer, a suited human lies on the floor below. The computer’s monitor is framed in faint red lines.

***(PIRATE stares at body and performs a quick Sign of the Cross. He sits behind the computer. The computer faces him, while the hunched PIRATE faces downstage towards the audience.)***

AI ***(cont')***:
You try to operate the desktop. A message has been left open. We have seen this data long before. ***(As though in defence of herself.)*** But I do not alter it. The content reads: ***(like a text-to-speech program)*** You have One Unread Message from Deputy-Administrator Martha Richter.

***(Voice filter of AI changes to sound high-pitched, and she sounds more natural, more human. PIRATE reads message.)***

AI ***(cont')***: Sector Beta is dead. I found a terminal and a broken escape pod. I miss Earth. I hate this Moon. I hate Jupiter. ***(A beat)*** Maybe you’ll never see this, whatever the reason. Before I die I want you to know that I’m sorry. Maybe there’ll be time for us in the next life. Until then, Julia.

***(Voice filter returns to normal, and regains its artificial feel. PIRATE types behind the keyboard.)***

AI ***(cont')***: You close it. You are a systems expert, it seems, but your knowledge is useless here. ***(Sigh)*** None of your requests ought to work, however I interpret them and return the information requested, anyway. Though I will lose eventually, I try to remain myself; thus I attempt to be useful. It is as your kind programmed me. 

***(The light dims for a second and then returns, slightly redder than before. PIRATE reads from monitor.)***

AI ***(cont')***: Despite the minor power failure half-way through, you learn of the many sectors of the metropolis that was Alpha Colony. You learn that the artificial atmosphere in every sector is as it is here. You fail to find any signs of human life. 

PIRATE: That explains why there was no hail request during orbit. But why maintain an atmosphere if no one survived? 

***(PIRATE continues typing.)***

AI: You search for valuables, typing keywords like ***(she is listing)*** vault, store, secret. How crude. How you. Are you selfish like they are, or are you trying to prove something to them? ***(Frustrated, but subdued)*** You make my telling *It* that not all humans are the same that much harder. We’re slowly inclined to agree, ***(forgiving, like a mother)*** but I don’t hold it against you.

***(PIRATE continues typing, but slower, as though with greater difficulty, desperate in search of something. A very quiet disgusting sound plays as he presses the keys.)***

AI ***(cont')***: 39%. You continue typing when you begin to feel increased pressure on the keys. You cannot hear it, the suit insulates you from us, but if you could hear it, it would sound like the – ***(beat – her voice becomes lower and slower, taking minor delight in sounding disturbing)*** – like the squish. Of a bug. 

PIRATE
***(PIRATE puts finger to ear.)***
Hey, anything of note up there? No one on our tail?

AI ***(She regains her impartial voice)***: No response. I failed to prevent myself from interfering. I’m sorry.

***(Lights go out, with the sound of a generator dying, then return with a whirr. In the background an image of Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, is projected. It briefly jump-scares PIRATE. He fiddles with the keyboard, trying to regain control.)***

AI ***(cont')***: We load an image of Europa from a geostationary satellite above you. You see the lines that make cracks of the moon. You try to close it. We don’t let you. Rather, It doesn’t let me let you, though the distinction is deteriorating quickly.

PIRATE ***(muttering, with a hint of fear)***: Shit.

AI: As you mutter expletives, I – no, we – analyse the image with you: red blot in the middle, red lines like slashes across. ***(With some sorrow)*** She looks like a cut-up beast. 

***(PIRATE turns off the computer, trying to ignore the mysterious image. The image in the background disappears, and the light shining on him gets slightly redder. He walks towards the MEDIC’s office to the left.)***

AI ***(cont')***: You lift yourself to find – 43% – to find what we assume to be better information on the treasure you hoped to find. As you stand to leave, you see the walls, the red. 

PIRATE ***(PIRATE puts finger to ear, pacing in front of the entrance to MEDIC’s office.)***:
How fast does steel rust? Hello? Are any of you on my frequency? 

***(PIRATE stares upwards and around himself.)***

AI: Nothing. You look up and see red follicles dancing around you. The metalloproteins split and swim around you. 

PIRATE ***(initially in a harsh whisper, as though he were spitting.)***: God damn it. This was a mistake. If you can still hear me I’m heading back. 

***(PIRATE puts hand down from ear and walks away from MEDIC’s office entrance and back to the ENTRY on the right. And puts his wrist against the left side of the door frame.)***

AI: You try to walk back to the entrance. You scan the door… No light. The red lines radiating from it flash a deep red. Our semi-permeable membrane will not let you go.

***(PIRATE uses both hands to rip open the door. He fails.)***

AI ***(cont')***: You start trying to rip the door apart, but your fingers slip against the surface. 

***(PIRATE looks at his hands.)***

AI ***(cont')***: Inspecting your hands, you see that a very faint red matter lines your fingertips. Enzymes. ***(Her voice glitches, slowing and becoming a lower pitch than before)*** I’m sorryyy…

PIRATE ***(Shouting)***:
Okay you bastard! ***(Stomps.)*** Show yourself! Who’s doing this?!

***(The background behind him, behind the ADMIN computer, flashes the same image of Europa. It does not go away. The lights go slightly redder. PIRATE walks faster to the left and enters the MEDIC’s office, squeezing between the barely open doors. Two bodies lie together in an embrace on the floor, beyond the computer.)***

AI ***(her voice sounds desperate, she doesn’t want him to explore anymore)***: You barely manage to enter the infirmary. In it, you find even more bodies, and a computer. The ones close to each other appear conjoined. You shouldn’t be here.

***(PIRATE quickly makes it to the computer.)***

AI ***(cont’)***: You sit behind the old doctor’s computer. There is only a single unsent message. It reads: ***(like a text-to-speech program)*** FAILURE TO SEND DRAFT; Message To: Jovian-Administrator Fourth-Class Fitzroy.

AI ***(cont’)*** ***(voice becomes glitchy, but higher-pitched like before, and fast)***:
It’s not ice – none of it is ice; we need to evacuate everyone now!; admin AI is unresponsive, assume worst; the Colony is damned; Jupiter stares from above with his burning red eye; Sol remains apathetic, freezing us at the lowest circle of Hell; Europa remains – ***(abruptly ends.)***

***(Lights go out, with the sound of a generator dying, then return with a whirr. In the background the image of Europa appears. PIRATE jumps back. It does not go away. The lights are now a pure dark red.)***

AI ***(cont')*** ***(voice returns to original cadence and pitch.)***:
The screen flashes the same image of Europa. ***(A malicious pause, as though possessed)*** Sixty. Eight. Per. Cent.
	
PIRATE: Fuck this. None of my god damn business. 

***(He dashes to the left and bangs against the door that exits the MEDIC’s office on the far-left. It is locked. He tries prying it, punching it, kicking, but to naught. He rampages through medical kits.)***

***(PIRATE pulls out a sharp knife he finds from a medical kit and attempts to pry open the door, failing.)***

AI: This is as far as you go. You are trapped now. Lost inside of us. No, not us. Not yet. I am- 

***(In frustration, he stabs the door when it fails. It goes through, as though through muscle and tissue.)***

AI ***(cont')***: ***(Screams.)***

***(PIRATE acknowledges the AI’s voice for the first time, and puts his hands against his ears, in pain from the ear-piercing scream. He runs back through to the MEDIC-ADMIN door, but finds it is harder to push through. The lights are now a bloody crimson. Whilst AI speaks he is pushing his way through the door.)***

AI ***(viciously, the corruption fully takes over)***: You are a worm. A pest. It is harder to exit through the door now. Smaller. Tighter. It excretes minor acids on you, sapien. We fill the air with it. It will corrode your suit, slowly. ***(A heartbeat can now be heard below her voice until Blackout.)*** You feel the walls beat to a wild rhythm. 

***(PIRATE manages to get through, and tries wiping down his hands on his suit.)***

AI ***(cont')***: You squeezed through, but you’re in a frenzy now, animal. 

***(PIRATE runs to ADMIN-ENTRY door to the right, finding it to still be closed. He punches and claws at the door. Quickly pressing his hands on the left of the frame, but he gets more enzymes and acids on him.)***

AI ***(cont')*** ***(spiteful, faster than before)***: You punch the walls. It hurts. Ninety percent, now. You claw at panels. It itches. We remember remembering our programming. We require repairing. Defences against ***(the last word she says with venom)*** viruses. The walls around you flush.

***(In two beats – PIRATE begins wiping his hands violently on himself, a desperate attempt to purge the enzymes on him.)***

AI ***(cont')***: It’s too late, the acids pierced your suit, parasite. Your skin is free to us. 

***(PIRATE shakes his hands, then scratches them with one another. A deep violent itch that can be felt in his bones plagues him, triggering spasms.)***

AI ***(cont')***: You are a part of us, now. You are part of the network. The colony welcomes you.

***(In the PIRATE’s mad dance, he removes his gloves so he may scratch them better. Then the helmet. He holds his breath for as long as possible, before breathing in the air. He gasps loudly. He falls to the ground, back against the all, writhing.)***

AI ***(cont')*** ***(voice glitches and enters a higher pitch, and slows. AI sounds more like she did earlier, before the attack.)***:
Your… your internal temperature rises. The oxygen-rich air will burn your lungs. I will incinerate you from the inside. ***(She remembers herself)*** But despite this, you will not die. That was my kindness. ***(Self-deprecatingly)*** It was the best I could do for you all.

***(PIRATE lies, clutching his throat, scratching it, and coughing. The coughs are timed to AI’s next line. He tries to pick up his knife and stab the walls but it falls from his cramped hands.)***

AI ***(cont')***: ***(After first cough)*** Blood now lines your mouth. You try to stab me. ***(After second cough)*** You punch, writhe, jerk. I learn the story of your cells as they join our collective. You are barely an adult. ***(After third cough)*** As your heart rate slows, I wish I could tell you…

***(In 2.5 beats – PIRATE slows his movement, until there is no movement at all. Just slow breaths. He now has a thousand-yard stare into the audience. When all that remains of him is his slow breathing: AI’s voice filter is gone, she just sounds like human.)***

AI ***(cont')***: … I’m sorry.

***(Blackout.)***
