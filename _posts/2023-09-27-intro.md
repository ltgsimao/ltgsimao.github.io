# Welcome!
I've had a few things written on my computer for a while and it felt like a waste to just leave them there accumulating digital dust. Besides, it's good to have a backup on GitHub either way in case something happens. Unless GitHub itself collapses, in which case we have more pressing issues to worry about.

Most of these are short stories I write in my free time, of which I very much welcome feedback on. Most are sci-fi, most are short, and (I like to think) most of them are good.

**_Enjoy!_**
